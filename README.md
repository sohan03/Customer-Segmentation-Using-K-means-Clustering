## Introduction
Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of marketing that involves dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics. This project demonstrates how to use K-means clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to perform customer segmentation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found [here](link-to-dataset). It includes various features such as age, income, spending score, etc.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sohan03/Customer-Segmentation-Using-K-means-Clustering/


   Navigate to the project directory:


Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Prepare your data by placing it in the data directory or modify the script to point to your dataset.
Run the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook
Open Customer_Segmentation_Kmeans.ipynb and follow the instructions to perform clustering and visualize the results
